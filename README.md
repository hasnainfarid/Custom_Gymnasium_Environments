# Custom Gymnasium Environments

This repository contains a collection of custom reinforcement learning environments built using the OpenAI Gymnasium API. The goal is to create a flexible and extensible suite of environments for experimentation, research, and prototyping in control, planning, and decision-making tasks.

Each environment follows the Gymnasium interface and is designed to be modular, lightweight, and easy to integrate into training pipelines. These environments can be useful for testing RL algorithms, benchmarking agent behavior, or exploring novel reward structures and dynamics.

New environments will continue to be added over time, covering a wide range of complexity and use cases.
