## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the package
cd space_station_env

# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Or install dependencies directly
pip install gymnasium numpy pygame
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from space_station_env import SpaceStationEnv

# Create environment
env = SpaceStationEnv(render_mode="human")

# Reset environment
observation, info = env.reset()

# Run simulation loop
for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    
    if terminated or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()
    
    env.render()

env.close()
```

### Using Gymnasium Registration

```python
import gymnasium as gym

# Environment is automatically registered on import
env = gym.make('SpaceStation-v0', render_mode="human")

observation, info = env.reset()
# ... continue as above
```

## Testing Scenarios

The package includes comprehensive testing with 6 emergency scenarios:

### Run All Scenarios with Automated Controller

python test_station.py --scenario power_failure --controller manual
```

### Available Scenarios
1. **normal**: Baseline operations
2. **power_failure**: Major power grid failure
3. **atmospheric_leak**: Hull breach and depressurization
4. **medical_emergency**: Crew member injury

4. **Power Systems** (10): Solar efficiency, battery, consumption metrics
5. **Resources** (8): Water, food, oxygen tanks, nitrogen, supplies, etc.
6. **Orbital Mechanics** (4): Phase, solar angle, shadow, radiation
7. **Emergency Alerts** (6): Fire, depressurization, radiation, etc.

## Action Space (40 discrete actions)

## Custom Controllers

### Implementing Your Own Controller

```python
class MyController:
    def get_action(self, observation, info):
        # Parse observation
        crew_health = observation[2::4][:6]
        system_efficiency = observation[24::3][:12]
        battery_level = observation[89]
        
        # Your control logic here
        if battery_level < 30:
            return 37  # Backup power
        elif min(crew_health) < 50:
            return 27  # Medical emergency
        else:
            return 39  # Normal operations
```

### Using with Training

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from stable_baselines3 import PPO

env = gym.make('SpaceStation-v0')
model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)
```
