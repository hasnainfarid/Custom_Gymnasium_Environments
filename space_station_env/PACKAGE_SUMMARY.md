- System status dashboard
- Resource gauges
- Orbital position display
- Emergency alerts
- Mission information

### Testing
- All 6 scenarios working
- Automated controller implemented
- Manual control with keyboard
- Mission reports generated
- Metrics saved to JSON

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### Quick Test
```bash
cd /workspace/space_station_env
python3 quick_test.py
```

### Run All Scenarios
```bash
python3 test_station.py --scenario all --controller auto --no-render
```

### With Visualization (if display available)
```bash
python3 test_station.py --scenario normal --controller auto
```

### In Python Code
```python
from space_station_env import SpaceStationEnv

env = SpaceStationEnv(render_mode="human")
obs, info = env.reset()

for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
    if terminated or truncated:
        break

env.close()
```

## âœ¨ Package Highlights
