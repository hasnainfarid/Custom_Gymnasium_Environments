## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Environment Specifications (100% Complete)
- **25x25 city grid** with urban delivery network simulation
- **3 specialized vehicles** (van, motorcycle, truck) starting at depot (12,12)
- **4 customer zones**: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Hospital
- **8-12 dynamic delivery requests** with urgency levels and vehicle requirements
- **Dynamic traffic congestion** changing every 50 timesteps
- **3 fuel stations** at strategic positions (5,5), (20,5), (5,20)

### ✅ State Space (87 dimensions)
- Vehicle positions (6 values: 3 vehicles × 2 coordinates)
- Vehicle fuel levels (3 values, normalized)
- Vehicle cargo usage (3 values, normalized)
- Current delivery assignments (3 values)
- Delivery request locations (24 values: 12 deliveries × 2 coordinates)
- Delivery urgency levels (12 values: 0-3 scale)
- Traffic congestion map (25 values: 5×5 grid flattened)

### ✅ Action Space (MultiDiscrete [8,8,8])
Per vehicle actions:
- 0: Stay in place
- 1-4: Move (Up/Down/Left/Right)
- 5: Pick up delivery
- 6: Drop off delivery  
- 7: Refuel at station

### ✅ Comprehensive Reward System
- **+200**: Urgent delivery completed on time
- **+100**: Normal delivery completed
- **+50**: Standard delivery completed
- **+15**: Efficient routing bonus
- **+10**: Successful refueling
- **-2**: Timestep cost per active vehicle
- **-5**: Heavy traffic movement penalty
- **-10**: Invalid action penalty
- **-20**: Late delivery penalty (urgency multiplied)
- **-50**: Vehicle out of fuel penalty

### ✅ Advanced Vehicle System
| Vehicle Type | Speed | Capacity | Fuel Consumption | Range | Special Use |
|-------------|-------|----------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| Van | 1 | 3 packages | 1.0/move | 80 steps | General purpose |
| Motorcycle | 1 | 1 package | 0.5/move | 120 steps | Hospital deliveries |
| Truck | 1 | 5 packages | 2.0/move | 60 steps | Industrial cargo |

### ✅ Rich Pygame Visualization
- **1000×800 window** with detailed grid rendering
- **Vehicle representation**: Van (blue square), Motorcycle (green circle), Truck (red rectangle)
- **Customer zones**: Color-coded backgrounds for each area
- **Delivery points**: Diamond shapes with urgency color coding
- **Traffic visualization**: Semi-transparent overlays (red=heavy, yellow=medium)
- **Fuel stations**: Gas pump icons
- **Real-time metrics panel**: Fuel levels, deliveries, timestep counter

### ✅ Comprehensive Testing Suite
- **3 test scenarios**: Light traffic, Heavy traffic, Mixed urgency
- **2 baseline agents**: Random and Greedy nearest-first
- **Performance tracking**: 12 KPIs including delivery rate, fuel efficiency, customer satisfaction
- **Advanced analytics**: Statistical analysis, visualization, performance reports
- **Automated benchmarking**: Compare strategies across scenarios

### ✅ Advanced Environment Features
- **Dynamic traffic patterns** with realistic congestion modeling
- **Weather effects** modifying fuel consumption every 100 timesteps
- **Vehicle-specific constraints** (hospital→motorcycle, industrial→truck)
- **Time windows** for deliveries (business hours vs 24/7)
- **Multi-objective optimization** balancing time, fuel, satisfaction

### ✅ Episode Termination Conditions
- All deliveries completed successfully
- All vehicles out of fuel
- 800 timesteps exceeded
- 50% of urgent deliveries missed deadline

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install package
pip install -e ./fleet_management_env

# Run demo
python -m fleet_management_env.demo --render

# Run comprehensive tests
python -m fleet_management_env.test_fleet
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import gymnasium as gym
import fleet_management_env

# Create environment
env = gym.make('FleetManagement-v0', render_mode='human')

# Run episode
observation, info = env.reset()
for step in range(1000):
    actions = env.action_space.sample()  # Random actions
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
    if terminated or truncated:
        break

env.close()
```
